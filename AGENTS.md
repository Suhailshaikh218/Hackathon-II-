# Spec-Driven Development Workflow

Always follow the Spec-Driven Development workflow:

1. Use 'speckit_specify' to create specs in the 'specs/' folder
2. Use 'speckit_plan' for technical plans
3. Use 'speckit_tasks' for the checklist in 'speckit.tasks'
4. Use 'speckit_implement' for coding

## Important Rule
Do not write code without a spec and a plan.
